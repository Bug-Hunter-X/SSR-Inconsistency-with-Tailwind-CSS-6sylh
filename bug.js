This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR). The issue arises when trying to style components that are dynamically rendered or conditionally rendered, where the Tailwind directives might not be processed correctly on the server. This results in the components appearing unstyled or with unexpected styles on the initial render.
